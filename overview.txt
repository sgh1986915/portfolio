-----------------------United States------------------
A veteran in the field of technology with over 30 years of experience as a programmer and 17 years of professional experience as a web development expert. Holds professional certificates from MIT and CompTIA and has a diverse background working for Inc. 500 companies, Fortune 500 companies, small businesses and a number of startup companies.

An expert in PHP, MySQL, Javascript, HTML, CSS as well as Laravel, CakePHP, Codeignitor. As a full stack developer I can help you find your way around any web development project. I can work as a developer on a team, or I can work as a lead developer or senior developer or even as your CTO with my nearly two decades of management experience.

I started programming computers when I was eight years old, and, over the last 30 years, I've realized that I am, well, a programmer. That said, I do have the "people skills" necessary to remain competitive in the world of programming. When needed, I'm a "sit in the corner and program til the wee hours of the morning geek"... otherwise, I'm just a "fun to talk to, easy to get along with normal person".

I have always enjoyed the challenge of creating interactive software. With the birth of the modern Internet, I found a new love in web development and web programming. I face every new piece of code as a fresh new beginning... a chance to do it even better, while, still using "what works" from the past.

My objective, here at UpWork, it to provide potential employers with my expertise in the field of website design, development, and programming.
